Variant 11

### General Task

Develop a Keeper class that implements a container for storing and processing objects. The Keeper class should provide the following functions:
- adding and removing derived objects of the abstract Base class (the base
class is defined according to the task option);
- full saving in a file;
- complete read from a file

### Individual Task

The Queue class contains data about the list, deck, and stack. Each one stores numbers. It is necessary to implement the functionality of each container based on queues.

### Restrictions

- Dynamic memory allocation
- No STL containers
- Full user menu
- User's access to interact with each of the inherited objects: add, delete, display, change data, etc
- All constructors, operator redefinition. Each call to
the constructor and destructor must be accompanied by the output of this
information to the user (which object, which constructor or destructor is
called)
- Set and get methods
- Exceptions
- Inheriting classes from the base class should define their essence by
variables and methods for working with them
